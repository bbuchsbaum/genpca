Description: Implements generalized principal components analysis. This
    extension of PCA finds maximal directions in an inner product space induced
    by two positive semidefinite matrices for the rows and columns.
    These constraint matrices can encode structural information, such as
    spatial or temporal correlations, that act as a prior on the PCA solution.
