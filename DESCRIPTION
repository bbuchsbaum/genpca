Description: An implementation of generalized principal components analysis, an extension of PCA
   that finds maximal directions in the data in an inner product space induced 
   by two positive semidefinite matrices, one for the rows of size n by n and one for the columns of 
   size p by p. These constraint matrices can encode structural information (e.g. spatial/temporal correlations) 
   that act as a kind of prior on the PCA solution.
